# ritsu.js
HTML form validation and utilities. Check out the [latest release.](https://github.com/NYPD/ritsu.js/releases)

## What is this?
A dumb and simple little HTML form validator. It relies heavily on HTML classes to make it very simple to validate input fields. Also comes with some spiffy utilities.

## Why?
This all started as a need to easily validate my own forms fields without being able to use someone else's validation plug-in. The result was a mini validation library that has worked pretty well for my projects.

Perhaps someone else will find this useful.

## Dependencies?
No dependencies! Uses pure javascript. Make sure to checkout the browser [compatibility table.](https://github.com/NYPD/ritsu.js/wiki#compatibility-table)

## Documentation
Read the [wiki.](https://github.com/NYPD/ritsu.js/wiki) Also there is probably tons of spelling mistakes and stuff. Please let me know if you find any.

## Anything else?
I'm wondering if I should switch this from a singleton apporach to something else.
