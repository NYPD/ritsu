# ritsu.js
HTML form validation and utilities.

## What is this?
A dumb and simple little HTML form validator. It relies heavily on HTML classes to make it very simple to validate input fields.

## Why?
This all started as a need to easily validate my own forms fields without being able to use someone else's validation plug-in. The result was a mini validation library that has worked pretty well for my projects.

Perhaps someone else will find this useful.

## Dependencies?
ritsu.js requires jQuery `v1.2.3` or greater to be included in your project. It also will try to with jQuery-compatible API's like [Zepto.js](http://zeptojs.com/).

As far as styling is concerned, ritsu.js uses [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) default styling class names. If Bootstrap is not being used in your project, include the ritsu.min.css / ritsu.css file in your page. Feel free to adapt your own styles if you want by implementing the CSS styles used in ritsu.js.

## Documentation
Read the [wiki.](https://github.com/NYPD/ritsu.js/wiki)

## Anything else?
Down the road I am planning to remove the jQuery dependency and go with a pure JavaScript approach.
