# ritsu.js
HTML form validation

## What is this?
A dumb and simple little HTML form validator. It relies heavily on HTML classes to make it very simple to validate input fields.

## Why?
This all started as a need to easily validate my own forms without being able to use someone else's validation plug-in. The result was a mini validation library that has worked pretty well for my projects.

Perhaps someone else will find this useful.

## Which?
The ritsu.js will assume you are using jQuery in your projects. Works with jQuery 1.7.2 + and I think should work with jQuery 1.6 as well.

The ritsu-zepto.js will use the [Zepto.js](http://zeptojs.com/) JavaScript library as substitution for jQuery if you do not have that in your project. Keep in mind the Zepto.js [supported browsers.](http://zeptojs.com/#browsers)

Ritsu.js uses [Bootstrap ](http://getbootstrap.com/) default styling class names. If Bootstrap is not being used in your project, include the ritsu.min.css / ritsu.css file in your page or copy the styles in there. Feel free to adapt your own styles.
