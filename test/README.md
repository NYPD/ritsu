### run
To run tests, simply navigate to the root ritsu.js git folder and run `npm test` or `npm nyan` if you are feeling kawaii.

### About
ritsu.js uses the [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/#getting-started) testing framework and [Chai](http://chaijs.com/) assesrtion library for its testing needs. Each `src` file has its own respective test file and the tests that need dom elements to work uses [jsdom](https://github.com/tmpvar/jsdom).
